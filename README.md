### Interests and Goals🌟
Passionate about Data, with a strong interest in analytics and predictive modeling. I consider myself a self-taught, problem-solving individual who enjoys working in a team.


Currently, I am actively persuing a junior position where I can apply and expand my skills. I want to join a team and a company that values growth, learning, and innovation, and where I can contribute meaningfully to challenging projects while developing my technical expertise.

I seek challenges that encourage growth and foster innovation
